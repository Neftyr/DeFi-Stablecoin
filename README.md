# Neftyr (NFR) Stablecoin Assumptions:

1. Relative Stability: Anchored/Pegged to $1.00 (Better here would be Floating (HARD version))
    - Chainlink price feed.
    - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC for $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting/Burning): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
    - People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (Coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous [Collateral that originates from outside of the protocol meaning if our stablecoin fails our underlying collateral doesn't fail] (Crypto)
    - ETH
    - BTC

Work on engine in progress...
